# JavaScript-LinkedList
This is my JavaScript implementation of a Linked List. I used the constructor (function()) method to create objects, 
instead of having classes like I did in my BST project so I can only create one instance of a Linked List, but the purpose of this project was to get a feel for JavaScript, and the LinkedList still works
