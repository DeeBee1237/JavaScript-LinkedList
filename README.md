# JavaScript-LinkedList
This is my JavaScript implementation of a Linked List. It isn't very good, since I used 
the constructor (function()) method to create objects, instead of having classes like I did 
in my BST project. I can only create one instance of a BST, but the purpose of this project 
was to get a feel for JavaScript
